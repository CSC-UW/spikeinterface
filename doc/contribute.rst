Contribute
==========

To contribute to SpikeInterface, a user/developer can help us integrate in a new recorded file
format, a new sorted file format, or a new spike sorting algorithm or more!

In order to make a contribution, you first need to **fork** the SpikeInterface repository.
Then you can clone from your fork, make a new branch (e.g. :code:`git checkout -b my-new-sorter`),
make changes to the code, commit and push to your fork.
Next, you can open a pull request (PR) from the "Pull Requests" tab of your fork to :code:`spikeinterface/master`.
This way, we'll be able to review the code and even make changes.

The next section explains how a spike sorter wrapper is organized:
